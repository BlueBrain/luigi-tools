Luigi tools
===========

This project aims to bring together the luigi tools used within the BBP.

Installation
------------

This package should be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install luigi-tools

Usage
-----

This package extends and adds new features to the [luigi package](https://luigi-tools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Here are a few examples of these features:

* add a new `BoolParameter` that automatically switch to explicit parsing when the default value is `True` (otherwise it is not possible to set it to `False` using the CLI).
* add several types of optional parameters.
* add a `OutputLocalTarget` class to help building an output tree.
* add a mixin that adds a `--rerun` parameter that forces a given task to run again even if its targets exist, and also rerun all the tasks that depend on this one.
* add a new `@copy_params` mechanism to copy the parameters from a task to another (the `@inherits` gives the same object to all the inheriting tasks while `@copy_params` only copies the definition of the parameter so each inheriting task can be given a different value).
* add functions to get and display the dependency graph of a given task.
* add a mechanism to setup templates for the `luigi.cfg` files, so the user just has to update specific values instead of copying the entire `luigi.cfg`.
